# Smart Radiator Thermostat Project

## 1. Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a **smart thermostat** that can automatically control a traditional radiator.  
The system will:
- Measure the **room temperature** using **two sensors** (one in the room and one near the battery) to calculate an **average temperature**.
- Allow users to **set a target temperature**.
- Adjust the **radiator valve** using a motor.
- Display **real-time temperature data** on a screen.
- Enable **scheduled temperature changes** at specific times.

### **Challenges**
- **Universal Motor Attachment:** The motor mechanism must be adaptable to different radiator valve types.
- **Auto-Calibration:** The system must learn how much to turn the valve to achieve the desired temperature.
- **Real-Time Safety:** If the **valve reaches its limit**, the motor must **immediately stop** to prevent mechanical damage.

## 3. Explanation of the Project

### **1. Temperature Measurement & Display**
- The system **reads temperature data** from **two sensors**:
  - One placed **in the room**.
  - One placed **near the battery**.
- The system **calculates an average temperature** for more accurate readings.
- The temperature is displayed on an **OLED/LCD screen**.

### **2. User Input & Configuration**
- The user can **set the target temperature** using **buttons or a rotary encoder**.
- A **timer function** allows scheduling changes (e.g., _"Set temperature to 22Â°C at 8:00 AM"_).

### **3. Radiator Valve Control**
- A **motor** is attached to the radiator valve and adjusts based on temperature differences.
- **Auto-calibration** detects the valve's motion range and maps it to temperature changes.
- **Real-Time Safety Feature:**  
  - If the radiator **cannot turn further**, the system will **immediately stop the motor** to prevent damage.

### **4. Communication & Processing**
- The **ESP32 microcontroller** processes **temperature data** and **user inputs**.
- It **controls the motor** to maintain the desired temperature.

### **5. Power & Hardware Integration**
- Powered via a **5V/12V adapter or a battery**.
- All components will be **mounted in a casing** attached to the radiator.

## 4. Key Challenges & Solutions

- **Universal Fit:**  
  - The motor attachment must be **adjustable** for different radiator types.  
  - Possible solutions: **3D-printed mounts** or **adjustable clamps**.

- **Auto-Calibration:**  
  - The system must determine how much to turn the valve to reach the target temperature.  
  - May require an **initial learning phase**.

- **Power Efficiency:**  
  - If **battery-powered**, the system should **enter low-power mode** when inactive.

- **Real-Time Safety Mechanism:**  
  - If the motor reaches its **movement limit**, it will **immediately stop** to prevent damage.
  - The system will detect **resistance** and halt operation.
