# Research on 3D Printing for Smart Radiator Thermostat  

## 1. Introduction  
This document outlines research conducted on **3D printing techniques, materials, and design considerations** for creating components for the **Smart Radiator Thermostat**. The goal is to design a **mounting system** and a **valve adapter** that securely integrates the motorized thermostat with various radiator valve types.

## 2. Why Use 3D Printing for This Project?  
- **Custom Fit:** 3D printing allows designing a **universal mounting system** that adapts to different radiator models.  
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Designs can be tested, modified, and reprinted quickly.  
- **Strength & Durability:** Printed parts can be strong enough to hold a **motor and withstand continuous force** from valve adjustments.  
- **Cost-Effective:** Cheaper than machining custom metal parts.

## 3. Important Design Considerations  

### **3.1. Material Selection**  
| Material | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **PLA (Polylactic Acid)** | Easy to print, low cost, environmentally friendly | Brittle, not heat-resistant |
| **PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol-Modified)** | Strong, impact-resistant, higher heat tolerance | Can be tricky to print |
| **ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)** | Heat-resistant, strong | Requires heated bed, warps easily |

### **Recommended Material:**
- **PETG** â†’ Strong, impact-resistant, and more heat-resistant than PLA.

### **3.2. Design Requirements for 3D Printed Parts**  
#### **1. Radiator Valve Adapter**  
- Must fit **standard radiator valve types**.  
- Should be **adjustable** for different radiator brands.  
- Needs **reinforced walls** to handle **torque from the motor**.  

#### **2. Motor Mount & Casing**  
- Must securely hold **stepper/servo motor** without vibration.  
- Should be **lightweight** but strong enough to support the motor force.  

#### **3. Attachment Mechanism**  
- Should allow **tool-free installation** on the radiator.
